- Before creating issue tickets, please check the issue tracker to avoid duplicates.
- Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
- Provide as much information as possible.

## Pull Requests

- Fork the repository and create your branch from `master`.
- If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
- Ensure your code lints and passes all tests.
- Write a convincing description of your PR and why we should land it.
- Make sure your PR is up-to-date with the current `master` branch.

## Coding Standards

- Use Prettier and ESLint to ensure your code follows the established standards.

## Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent.
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

Thank you for contributing!
